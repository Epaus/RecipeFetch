### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I wanted to make the app testable. So, I prioritzed viewmodels for testability.  Also, I wanted to provide mocking for geniune unit tests that did not depend on network connectivity.  I am new to SwiftUI with networking. So, I spent a lot of time learning with Combine tutorials. I took two Udemy classes in order to gain the understanding of what needed to be done. Because of that, a lot of step-wise refinement was involved as I delved deeper into the project and the requirements.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I worked on this project only a few hours at a time as I was able.  As well, I frequently had to go investigate areas by visiting and revisiting my Udemy classes. So, calendar-wise, it took me longer than I would like to admit. But, if I were working in one dedicated period, I probably spent 1.5 - 2 weeks (60 - 80 hours)
